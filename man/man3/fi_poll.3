.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS fi_poll_open
.PP
fi_poll_open creates a new polling set.
A poll set enables an optimized method for progressing asynchronous
operations across multiple completion queues and counters and checking
for their completions.
.PP
A poll set is defined with the following attributes.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
struct\ fi_poll_attr\ {
\ \ \ \ uint64_t\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ flags;\ \ \ \ \ /*\ operation\ flags\ */
};
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[I]flags\f[] : Flags that set the default operation of the poll set.
The use of this field is reserved and must be set to 0 by the caller.
.SS fi_close
.PP
The fi_close call releases all resources associated with a poll set.
The poll set must not be associated with any other resources prior to
being closed, otherwise the call will return -FI_EBUSY.
.SS fi_poll_add
.PP
Associates a completion queue or counter with a poll set.
.SS fi_poll_del
.PP
Removes an completion queue or counter from a poll set.
.SS fi_poll
.PP
Progresses all completion queues and counters associated with a poll set
and checks for events.
If events have occurred, contexts associated with the completion queues
and/or counters are returned.
Completion queues will return their context if they are not empty.
The context associated with a counter will be returned if the
counter\[aq]s success value or error value have changed since the last
time fi_poll was called.
The number of contexts is limited to the size of the context array,
indicated by the count parameter.
.SS fi_wait_open
.PP
fi_wait_open allocates a new wait set.
A wait set enables an optimized method of waiting for events across
multiple completion queues and counters.
Where possible, a wait set uses a single underlying wait object that is
signaled when a specified condition occurs on an associated completion
queue or counter.
.PP
The properties and behavior of a wait set are defined by struct
fi_wait_attr.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
struct\ fi_wait_attr\ {
\ \ \ \ enum\ fi_wait_obj\ \ \ \ \ wait_obj;\ \ /*\ requested\ wait\ object\ */
\ \ \ \ uint64_t\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ flags;\ \ \ \ \ /*\ operation\ flags\ */
};
\f[]
.fi
.PP
\f[I]wait_obj\f[] : Wait sets are associated with specific wait
object(s).
Wait objects allow applications to block until the wait object is
signaled, indicating that an event is available to be read.
The following values may be used to specify the type of wait object
associated with a wait set: FI_WAIT_UNSPEC, FI_WAIT_FD, and
FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]FI_WAIT_UNSPEC\f[] : Specifies that the user will only wait on the
wait set using fabric interface calls, such as fi_wait.
In this case, the underlying provider may select the most appropriate or
highest performing wait object available, including custom wait
mechanisms.
Applications that select FI_WAIT_UNSPEC are not guaranteed to retrieve
the underlying wait object.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]FI_WAIT_FD\f[] : Indicates that the wait set should use file
descriptor(s) as its wait mechanism.
It may not always be possible for a wait set to be implemented using a
single underlying file descriptor, but all wait objects will be file
descriptors.
File descriptor wait objects must be usable in select, poll, and epoll
routines.
However, a provider may signal an FD wait object by marking it as
readable, writable, or with an error.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND\f[] : Specifies that the wait set should use a
pthread mutex and cond variable as a wait object.
.PP
\f[I]flags\f[] : Flags that set the default operation of the wait set.
The use of this field is reserved and must be set to 0 by the caller.
.SS fi_close
.PP
The fi_close call releases all resources associated with a wait set.
The wait set must not be bound to any other opened resources prior to
being closed, otherwise the call will return -FI_EBUSY.
.SS fi_wait
.PP
Waits on a wait set until one or more of its underlying wait objects is
signaled.
.SS fi_control
.PP
The fi_control call is used to access provider or implementation
specific details of the wait set.
Access to the wait set should be serialized across all calls when
fi_control is invoked, as it may redirect the implementation of wait set
operations.
The following control commands are usable with a wait set.
.PP
\f[I]FI_GETWAIT (void **)\f[] : This command allows the user to retrieve
the low-level wait object associated with the wait set.
The format of the wait set is specified during wait set creation,
through the wait set attributes.
The fi_control arg parameter should be an address where a pointer to the
returned wait object will be written.
This should be an \[aq]int *\[aq] for FI_WAIT_FD, or \[aq]struct
fi_mutex_cond\[aq] for FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND.
Support for FI_GETWAIT is provider specific and may fail if not
supported or if the wait set is implemented using more than one wait
object.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
Returns 0 on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[].
.PP
fi_poll : On success, if events are available, returns the number of
entries written to the context array.
